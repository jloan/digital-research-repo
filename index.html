<h1>What is Digital Research and Scholarship?</h1>

<p>"...a broad, interdisciplinary field that includes computationally engaged research and pedagogy, and digital publication. The field integrates traditional scholarly methods with new and newly emerging technologies to question and investigate traditional scholarly paradigms and utilize new methods of working.

Researchers and students interested in digital or open scholarship are prepared to integrate scholarly methodologies with technological skills.  Examples include open publishing, community-engaged research, text analysis, data mining, visualization, modeling and simulation, geospatial analysis and mapping, multi-modal storytelling, network analysis, and mark-up." - University of Washington Libraries</p>

<h1>Why did I write this? Who is this for?</h1>

<p>Given all the possibilities and dangers of AI, we are -- justifiably -- in a heightened moment of anxiety and fear about the role digital technologies will play in our teaching and learning. We certainly have much to fear and be anxious about. As a writing teacher at Pierce College, a comunity college in Washigton State, my biggest fear is that we will shy away from bringing the challenges and possibilities of digital reserch and scholarship into the community college context as a gut-response to this situation. My argument is that now, mre than ever, it is important for us to engage with and interogate the digital in the context of our teaching and learning.</p>

<p>This zine -- and other zines in this series -- are written specifically for both teachers and stuents at Pierce College, but more generally for any community college faculty or students. This project follwos in the footsteps of community college faculty like Anne McGrail, who have for many years been leaders in advocating for community colleges to engage with digital research and scholarship and for fields like the digital humanities to engage community colleges. (see "Whole Game")</p>

<h1>Why Zines?</h1>

<p>Zines offer a great on ramp for experimenting with digital research and scholarship. Zines ask you to consider questions of:</p>
<ul>
<li>genre</li>
<li>rhetorical awareness</li>
<li>participatory literacy and culture</li>
<li>materiality</li>
<li>technology and writing</li>
<li>making and craft</li>
<li>multimodality</li>
</ul>
<p>All key concepts in attempting to integrate traditional and new research methodologies with technological comptencies.</p>

<p>Historically (and even NOW!) zines are small-scale, handmade publications. This makes zines a genre with capacity to resist an all consuming vision of digital culture. Much they offered punks and queers and communities in a time before ubiquitous computing a capacity for resisting an all comsuming vision of mass media.(see Radway; Piepmeirer)</p>

<p>"When, in college, a spirited English teaching assistant (who once canceled class for the week to attend a riot-grrrl punk reunion show in Washington) introduced me to zines and the early feminist publishing movement of the 1990s, I felt as if I had been given a lifeline to the outside world. Those self-published, unofficial magazines offered tangible glimpses of radical feminism, social-justice movements, queer history and subcultures that I always knew existed but had little access to. The world seemed to open up for me." - Jenna Wortham</p>
