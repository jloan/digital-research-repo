<h1>What is Digital Research and Scholarship?</h1>

<p>"...a broad, interdisciplinary field that includes computationally engaged research and pedagogy, and digital publication. The field integrates traditional scholarly methods with new and newly emerging technologies to question and investigate traditional scholarly paradigms and utilize new methods of working.

Researchers and students interested in digital or open scholarship are prepared to integrate scholarly methodologies with technological skills.  Examples include open publishing, community-engaged research, text analysis, data mining, visualization, modeling and simulation, geospatial analysis and mapping, multi-modal storytelling, network analysis, and mark-up." - University of Washington Libraries</p>

<h1>Why did I write this? Who is this for?</h1>

<p>Given all the possibilities and dangers of AI, we are -- justifiably -- in a heightened moment of anxiety and fear about the role digital technologies will play in our teaching and learning. We certainly have much to fear and be anxious about when it comes to AI systems like ChatGPT. As a writing teacher at Pierce College, a comunity college in Washigton State, my biggest fear is that we will shy away from bringing the challenges and possibilities of digital reserch and scholarship into the community college context. My position is that now, mre than ever, it is important for use to engage with and interogate the digital in the context of our teaching and learning.</p>
